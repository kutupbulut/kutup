//! The durable-store port and its unit-of-work.
//!
//! [`ChatDb`] is the seam every platform implements: native (Android/iOS/desktop)
//! over bundled SQLite ([`sqlite::SqliteChatDb`], behind the `sqlite` feature),
//! the web client over IndexedDB (a separate wasm adapter, `--no-default-features`).
//! It is an **async, `?Send`** blob store: native SQLite completes calls
//! immediately, while browser IndexedDB is allowed to yield. This matches
//! libsignal's async store traits without blocking the browser main thread.
//!
//! Reads are typed by domain and return the raw libsignal-serialized record bytes;
//! all writes for one crypto operation are staged in a [`Pending`] and committed in
//! a single atomic [`ChatDb::apply`]. Because nothing is durable until `apply`
//! returns `Ok`, a crash mid-operation leaves the last committed state intact —
//! the foundation for the decrypt→persist→ack ordering invariant (`docs/chat-protocol.md`).
