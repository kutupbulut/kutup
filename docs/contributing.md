# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. This guide covers local development setup for both the backend and frontend.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| Rust | 1.91.1+ (stable) | https://rustup.rs/ |
| Node.js | 22 (CI version) | https://nodejs.org/ |
| pnpm | 10.28.2 (root package and CI) | `corepack enable` |
| Docker + Compose v2 | latest | https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ |

---

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone and configure

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kutupbt/kutup.git
cd kutup
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in required values — see README for the configuration table
```

### 2. Start infrastructure (database + storage)

The easiest approach is to run the full stack and then replace only the service you're working on:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

For faster iteration, you can run just the infrastructure services and run the backend/frontend natively:

```sh
docker compose up -d postgres seaweedfs-master seaweedfs-volume seaweedfs-filer seaweedfs-s3 seaweedfs-init
```

---

## Backend Development

The backend is a Rust application — `crates/kutup-server` (Axum + sqlx + aws-sdk-s3) in the
root Cargo workspace. It shares the E2EE primitives with the CLI via `crates/kutup-crypto`.

### Running natively

```sh
# Export env vars (or use a tool like direnv)
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://kutup:<POSTGRES_PASSWORD>@localhost:5432/kutup?sslmode=disable"
export JWT_SECRET="<your-jwt-secret-32+chars>"
export S3_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:8333"
export S3_ACCESS_KEY="kutup"
export S3_SECRET_KEY="<your-s3-secret>"
export S3_BUCKET="kutup-files"
export S3_REGION="us-east-1"
export APP_ENV="development"

cargo run -p kutup-server          # or: cargo build --release -p kutup-server
```

The backend starts on `http://localhost:3000`. The binary also has an `orphan-sweep`
subcommand (`cargo run -p kutup-server -- orphan-sweep [--delete]`) for GC'ing orphaned S3
blobs.

> You need to expose the SeaweedFS S3 port to the host. Add `ports: ["8333:8333"]` to the `seaweedfs-s3` service in `docker-compose.yml` temporarily for local dev.

### Database migrations

Migrations live in `crates/kutup-server/migrations/` (`<N>_<name>.up.sql` / `.down.sql` —
sqlx's reversible format) and are **embedded into the binary at compile time** via
`sqlx::migrate!()`, then applied automatically on startup.

To add a migration, create the pair by hand (or with the sqlx CLI):

```sh
cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features postgres   # one-time
sqlx migrate add -r <migration_name> --source crates/kutup-server/migrations
```

Write the forward migration in `.up.sql` and the rollback in `.down.sql`. Because migrations
are embedded at compile time, **rebuild** the server after adding one.

### OpenAPI

The server generates its OpenAPI document with [`utoipa`](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa)
and serves the machine-readable JSON at `GET /api-docs/openapi.json`. Every HTTP
operation has a path annotation, and a coverage test keeps the generated route set aligned
with the Axum router. An interactive Swagger UI is deferred (see `docs/roadmap.md`).

### Running tests

```sh
cargo test                                      # all crates
cargo test -p kutup-crypto                      # crypto byte-parity vectors
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings       # lints (gate)
cargo fmt --check                               # formatting (gate)
python3 scripts/test-check-docs.py               # checker regression tests
python3 scripts/check-docs.py                    # Markdown links and referenced paths
./scripts/audit-unified-federation.sh           # no feature-owned federation stack
./scripts/test-chat-backup-integration.sh        # real Postgres/SeaweedFS backup lifecycle
./scripts/test-chat-federation.sh               # full two-server API + browser security/recovery gate
./scripts/dev-chat-federation-up.sh              # leave an MLS-enabled two-server stack running
```

The backup integration script owns a disposable Compose project and covers the
HTTP lifecycle, fixed-cutoff mailbox/media retention, account purge, object
cleanup, and exact Chat-byte release. It tears down its Postgres and SeaweedFS
state even on failure.

The federation harness uses its own Compose project, two tmpfs Postgres
databases, and host ports 39081/39082. Despite its historical filename, it is
the unified Chat + Drive gate: Drive establishes the first peer pin, Chat must
reuse that same identity and policy, and the suite checks the shared admin
evidence/retry/audit control plane. It also covers the Drive share lifecycle,
Chat delivery and durable retry, the global emergency stop, all four admission
modes and directional domain rules independently for both features, and
disabled feature capabilities. Its Playwright phase also covers Direct and MLS
security, media, clean two-account browser-loss recovery, lazy protected-media
restore, and fresh post-restore protocol state. It tears the topology down on
exit and does not touch the ordinary development stack. Set `KUTUP_FEDERATION_SKIP_BUILD=1`
only when reusing an image already built from the current checkout.

Run these local gates before requesting or rerunning GitHub CI. CI is final
confirmation, not the first debugging environment. See
[`tests/e2e/README.md`](../tests/e2e/README.md) for the single-server recovery
command, TLS prerequisite, zero-retry policy, and sanitized failure artifacts.

Markdown-only and `docs/**`-only pull requests/pushes run the lightweight
`Documentation` workflow instead of the Rust, WASM, frontend, integration, and
browser matrix. It validates local links, referenced script/workflow/spec paths,
changed-file whitespace, and Compose parsing. A mixed documentation-and-code
change still runs the complete `CI` workflow as well as documentation checks.

For manual browser testing, use `./scripts/dev-chat-federation-up.sh` instead
of invoking `docker-compose.chat-federation.yml` directly. The helper starts
the same real two-server topology, completes the authenticated admin bootstrap,
and changes both Chat federation policies from their fail-closed allowlist
default to `open`. It is repeatable while its tmpfs databases remain running.
The script prints both URLs and the development-only admin credentials. Override
`KUTUP_FEDERATION_PROJECT`, `KUTUP_FED_A_PORT`, and `KUTUP_FED_B_PORT` to run an
additional isolated topology.

The intentionally breaking Chat and Drive cutovers have separate up/down
isolation fixtures. Point `KUTUP_TEST_DB` at a disposable PostgreSQL database;
each test creates and removes its own randomized schema while proving local
product rows survive:

```sh
KUTUP_TEST_DB=postgres://... cargo test -p kutup-server \
  --test federation_phase_c_migration_live -- --nocapture
KUTUP_TEST_DB=postgres://... cargo test -p kutup-server \
  --test federation_phase_d_migration_live -- --nocapture
```

---

## Frontend Development

The frontend is a React 18 + TypeScript app in `frontend/`, built with Vite.

### Running natively

```sh
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Vite starts on `http://localhost:5173`. The `vite.config.ts` includes a proxy rule that forwards `/api` requests to the backend at `http://localhost:3000`, so you can develop against a running backend without CORS issues.

### Building for production

```sh
pnpm build
```

Output goes to `frontend/dist/`, which is then served by the frontend Nginx container.

### TypeScript

The project uses strict TypeScript (`"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`). All new code must type-check cleanly. Run the type checker:

```sh
pnpm tsc --noEmit
```

## Operations

### Orphan-blob sweep

Periodic admin task that walks SeaweedFS for blobs whose containing `files.id` row no longer exists (PUT-then-crash leftovers, residual snapshot blobs from before quota tracking, etc.) and deletes them.

Subcommand on the existing `kutup-server` binary — same Docker image, same env vars, same DB pool.

**Always start with a dry-run.** Default behaviour reports orphans without touching them.

```sh
# Dry-run (default). Lists orphans + summary; no deletions.
docker compose exec backend ./kutup-server orphan-sweep

# Tighter age window for testing — anything older than 1h is fair game.
docker compose exec backend ./kutup-server orphan-sweep --age-floor=1h

# After verifying the dry-run output looks right, actually delete.
docker compose exec backend ./kutup-server orphan-sweep --delete
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `--delete` | `false` | Without this, the command is a dry-run. |
| `--age-floor` | `24h` | Skip blobs younger than this. The 24h default absorbs in-flight uploads; lower it only for testing. |
| `--page-sleep` | `200ms` | Sleep between S3 LIST pages. |
| `--prefix` | `files/` | S3 key prefix to walk. |

**Reading the summary log:**

```
orphan-sweep summary: pages=N keys=N orphans=N skipped-age=N skipped-shape=N deleted=N bytes-reclaimed=N mode=dry-run|delete
```

- `skipped-age` should be > 0 on a healthy bucket (the in-flight upload window). If it's 0 every run, the age floor isn't engaging — investigate before relying on the result.
- `skipped-shape` counts keys outside the `files/<UUID>/...` shape; the sweep never deletes these.
- `bytes-reclaimed` is the projected (dry-run) or actual (`--delete`) byte savings.

The sweep does **not** persist progress — a crash mid-run means rerunning from scratch. Acceptable at current scale; revisit if the bucket grows past ~500K objects.

## Code Conventions

### Backend (Rust)

- Axum handlers organized by domain (`crates/kutup-server/src/handlers/` — auth, collections, files, shares, federation, admin, …). Each file opens with a `//!` doc comment.
- Use `sqlx` runtime queries (`sqlx::query`/`query_as`) — no compile-time-checked macros (no live DB at build), no ORM.
- All cryptographic operations are the client's responsibility; the backend must never attempt to decrypt anything. Shared primitives live in `crates/kutup-crypto`.
- SSRF validation (`crates/kutup-server/src/ssrf.rs`) must be applied to all user-supplied URLs before making outbound requests (federation).
- Gate every change with `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` + `cargo fmt` + `cargo test`.

### Frontend (TypeScript)

- Strict mode is enforced. No `any` types.
- Authored frontend files use `.ts` and `.tsx` only; do not add `.js` or `.jsx`.
- All cryptographic operations go in `src/crypto/`. Components and pages must not call libsodium directly.
- KDF (Argon2id) runs in `src/workers/kdf.worker.ts` to avoid blocking the main thread.
- State management uses Redux Toolkit slices. Keep slices thin — business logic goes in thunks or service functions.
- API calls go through `src/api/client.ts`, which handles token injection and refresh.
- Use semantic theme roles and the responsive ownership boundaries documented
  in [`frontend.md`](frontend.md). A viewport change must not remount services
  or trigger a mutation.

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `master`.
2. Make focused, well-described commits. Each commit should be buildable and leave tests passing.
3. Open a pull request against `master`. Describe **why** the change is needed, not just what it does.
4. For security-related changes (cryptography, authentication, federation), include a brief explanation of the security model impact.

For bug reports and feature requests, open a GitHub issue.
